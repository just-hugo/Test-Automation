This repository houses my earliest attempts at coding, as well as "homework" projects given to me during job interviews.

I learned to code as an intern test engineer at a small startup called Stepwise Testing. I was employee #1, and the owner was excited to mentor new people in tech roles. As part of my training, he had me practice automating websites for well-known brands, such as `Geico` or `United Airline`.

My next employer, `Rocketmiles`, requested that I send them a project showing some automation testing of their site. Using the models I had learned at Stepwise, I created a project to complete a booking flow on their site.

My current employer, `Syndio`, asked something similar of me: to provide a basic automated test for a mock dashboard they had set up.

I enjoy keeping these projects because I cut my teeth in tech by learning test automation, and I love seeing my growth charted through these projects.
